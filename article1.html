            <p>Australian cyclist Luke Plapp has been rushed to hospital for surgery after a shocking crash during the men’s time trial at the Paris Olympics.</p>

            <p>Plapp is now in a stable condition after the crash, which occurred on Sunday morning (AEST), AusCycling said.</p>

            <p>The 23-year-old Victorian rider required abdominal surgery and remains in hospital. His parents and an Australian team doctor are by his side.</p>

            <p>“Plapp was taken to hospital, where he is in a stable condition awaiting the results of scans,” AusCycling said.</p>

            <p>The association later issued an update stating, “Plapp underwent abdominal surgery in a Paris hospital overnight”.</p>

            <p>The three-time national road race champion and two-time national time trial champion came off his bike at about the 13.1km checkpoint and had set the fourth-fastest time at that moment, after a promising start to the race.</p>

            <p>He was just two seconds behind then-leader Wout van Aert from Belgium.</p>

            <p>Plapp had been competing in wet, dangerous conditions when disaster struck in the technical middle section. He was forced to abandon the race.</p>

            <p>There have been calls for footage of the incident not to be shared online, after it began popping up on social media. While the broadcast didn't show how the crash happened, video on social media shows Plapp lying on the rain-soaked ground near a barrier before being helped up by an Australian team support member.</p>
