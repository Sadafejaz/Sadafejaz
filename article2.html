            <p>The number of repossessed vehicles on sale has continued to climb as Australians face a worsening cost of living crisis.</p>

            <p>Auction site Pickles reported an average increase in repossessed cars hitting the auction of 13 per cent in the past six months.</p>

            <p>In the second quarter of 2024 – April to June – the number of reclaimed vehicles rose again by 11 per cent from the first three months of 2024.</p>

            <p>Pickles noted in their second quarterly report the “significant rate” in which repossessed vehicles were coming before auction was due to multiple factors.</p>

            <p>“Pickles considers the two key contributing factors behind this growth to be ongoing cost-of-living pressures – relating to high CPI inflation and interest rates – along with owners’ ability to refinance diminishing as vehicle values generally decline, contrary to the booming used (car) values prior to the second quarter of 2022,” the report stated.</p>

            <p>According to the report, the volume of used vehicles continued to grow with a new post-Covid record and a 34 per cent increase year-on-year in the sale of second-hand cars.</p>

            <p>Notably, the number of used electric vehicles, or EVs, also rose by a record 91 per cent in the second quarter of 2024 with a whopping 82 vehicles hitting the auction block.</p>

            <p>“This represents year-on-year growth of 246 per cent, which underlines Pickles’ growing status as the place to buy a used EV,” the report stated.</p>

            <p>“A more steady growth pattern is expected for the rest of 2024, but we are witnessing the greatest shift in fuel types in generations.”</p>
