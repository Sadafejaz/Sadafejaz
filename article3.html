            <p>Three out of four members of an American gospel singing group have been killed in a plane crash in northeast Wyoming.</p>
            <p>The plane, carrying seven passengers in total, crashed while taking a flight to perform on a cruise ship.</p>
            <p>Seven people on board the small aircraft died, include Jason Clark, Kelly Nelon Clark and their daughter Amber Kistler from The Nelons group. The trio, according to management, were travelling to perform on board the ship.</p>

            <p>On social media, the band’s representatives — the Gaither Management Group — confirmed the tragedy.</p>
            <p>“One of the best loved gospel music families in America, the Nelons were involved in a tragic, fatal plane crash on Friday afternoon on their way to join the Gaither Homecoming cruise to Alaska,” the statement on Instagram read.</p>
            <p>“Killed in the crash were Jason and Kelly Nelon Clark, Amber and Nathan Kistler and their assistant, Melodi Hodges, along with the pilot, Larry Haynie and his wife, Melissa.”</p>
            <p>While investigations into what caused the crash are ongoing, the National Transportation Safety Board said early indications suggest an “autopilot issue during flight”, and while a preliminary report on the crash should be available in 30 days, a full report may take up to two years.</p>
            <p>“The aircraft is in a remote location and once they gain access they will begin documenting the scene, examining the aircraft,” the spokesperson said. “The aircraft will then be recovered and taken to a secure facility for further evaluation.”</p>
            <p>The Nelons, a popular gospel singing group, were started by Kelly Nelon Clark’s father, Rex Nelon, in the 1970s. The group was inducted into the Gospel Music Association (GMA) Hall of Fame in 2016, and had also won GMA Dove awards, including awards for song of the year and album of the year.</p>
            <p>According to NBC, The Nelons have recorded more than 35 albums and amassed over 20 Top 5 Southern Gospel radio singles for songs including “Thanks,” “Come Morning,” “We Shall Wear a Robe and Crown” and “O for a Thousand Tongues”.</p>
            <p>The Clark’s youngest daughter, Autumn Nelon Streetman and who was not on the aircraft, paid tribute to her family members lost in the horror crash.</p>
            <p>“As many of you have heard by now, my father and mother, Jason and Kelly Nelon Clark, along with my sister, Amber, and brother-in-law, Nathan, as well as our dear friends Melodi Hodges, Larry and Melissa Haynie, were involved in a tragic plane crash on Friday,” she wrote.</p>
            <p>“Thank you for the prayers that have been extended already to me, my husband, Jamie, and our soon-to-be-born baby boy, as well as Jason’s parents, Dan and Linda Clark. We appreciate your continued prayers, love and support as we navigate the coming days.”</p>
